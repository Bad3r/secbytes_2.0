Different techniques for preventing commands from being stored in `$HISTFILE`
<!--more-->
# ❯ Bash history
Bash maintains the list of commands internally in memory while it's running. They are written into `$HISTFILE` (i.e, `~/.bash_history`)  when a user logs off. 

```powershell
❯ echo $HISTFILE           
/home/bad3r/.bash_history
```

This post is a cheat sheet for common methods attackers use to hide commands from being saved in the history file or in memory



## ❯ Leading Space

Might not be enabled by default in some distros 

Starting each command with a leading space character

```powershell
❯ echo "hello"
hello
❯  echo "ritsec"
ritsec
❯ history 
    1  ls
    2  echo "hello"
    3  history 
```

Notice that the command `$echo "hello"` was saved  history unlike the commas with a leading space `$ echo "ritsec"`. This is possible because of `HISTCONTROL` environment variable 

```powershell
❯ head -2 /etc/os-release
 NAME="Ubuntu" 
 VERSION="18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver)" 
❯ echo $HISTCONTROL
 ignoredups:ignorespace
```


## ❯ `HISTFILE` 
The `HISTFILE` environment variable specifies bash history file

```powershell
❯ man bash
HISTFILE
  The  name  of the file in which command history is saved (see HISTORY be‐
  low).  The default value is ~/.bash_history.  If unset, the command  his‐
  tory is not saved when a shell exits.
  the  value of HISTIGNORE.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the
  extglob shell option.
```
```powershell
❯ echo $HISTFILE
/home/bad3r/.bash_history
```

To avoid recording commands to the file in `$HISTFILE` set `HISTFILE` value to `/dev/null` 

```powershell
❯ HISTFILE=/dev/null
OR
❯ export HISTFILE=/dev/null
```

### ❯ Using unset 

```powershell
man bash
unset
  Remove variable or function names
```
We can use `unset` to remove the variable `HISTFILE` for the current session 
```powershell
❯ echo $HISTFILE
/root/.bash_history
❯ unset HISTFILE
❯ echo $HISTFILE

❯
```  
Note that it will only effect the current session. If you start another session the variable `HISTFILE` will still be set unlike changing `$HISTILE` value to `/dev/null`



## ❯ `HISTSIZE` & `HISTFILESIZE`

Notice the distinction between `file`: on disk - and `list`: in memory.

`HISTSIZE` is the number of lines or commands that are stored in memory in a history list while your bash session is ongoing.

```powershell
❯ man bash

HISTSIZE
  The number of commands to remember in the command  history  (see  HISTORY
  below).   If  the value is 0, commands are not saved in the history list.
  Numeric values less than zero result in every command being saved on  the
  history  list  (there  is no limit).  The shell sets the default value to
  500 after reading any startup files.
```

In order to remove all commands from to the history list in memory change the size to 0

```powershell
❯ echo $HISTSIZE
1000
❯ HISTSIZE=0  # OR export HISTSIZE=0
❯ echo $HISTSIZE
0
```

`HISTFILESIZE` is the number of lines or commands that 
-  are allowed in the history file at startup time of a session, and
-  are stored in the history file at the end of your bash session for use in future sessions.

```powershell
❯ man bash

HISTFILESIZE
  The  maximum  number  of  lines contained in the history file.  When this
  variable is assigned a value, the history file is  truncated,  if  neces‐
  sary, to contain no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest
  entries.  The history file is also truncated to this size  after  writing
  it  when a shell exits.  If the value is 0, the history file is truncated
  to zero size.  Non-numeric values and numeric values less than  zero  in‐
  hibit truncation.  The shell sets the default value to the value of HIST‐
  SIZE after reading any startup files.
```
&nbsp;

```powershell
❯ echo $HISTFILESIZE
2000
❯ HISTFILESIZE=0  # OR export HISTFILESIZE=0
```

## ❯ The Set & Shopt Builtin

The `set` builtin allows you to change the values of shell options and set the positional parameters, or to display the names and values of shell variables.
Using `set` we can avoid recording new commands to the history list in memory. And,  because it's not being saved in memory, it can not be recorded to file


- `-o` option-name:    Set the option corresponding to option-name 

The option name here is `history` and its enabled by default. Using ‘+’ rather than ‘-’ causes these options to be turned off

```powershell
❯ set +o history
```
Using ‘-’ we can enable it again;

```powershell
❯ set -o history
```

Alternatively the `shopt` builtin command can be used
shopt builtin command allows you to change additional shell optional behavior.

- `-u`    Disable (unset) each optname.
` `-o`    Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for the -o option to the set builtin


```powershell
❯ shopt -ou history
```

Re-enable it using the `-s` flag; 
- `-s`    Enable (set) each optname.


```powershell
❯ shopt -os history
```


## ❯ Clearing the History
Rather than disabling command history, we can clear the history on the current bash shell by simply using the `history` command with the `-c` (clear) flag

```powershell
❯ history -c
```
Then, to make certain the changes are written to disk, we need to tell the history command to write to disk with the `-w` flag

```powershell
❯ history -w
```
This only clears the history of the current shell. Commands run in other shells will remain on disk.


## ❯ Shredding the History

```powershell
❯ man shred
  shred - overwrite a file to hide its contents, and optionally delete it
```

The `shred` command shreds the target file making it unreadable

```powershell
❯ cat $HISTFILE
ls
history -w
❯ shred $HISTFILE
❯ cat $HISTFILE
 ,Iç!hù2g2V?ƥf[Æ{L´w٘Ì˿vCÓ/Zs
PìPõä{K{ëúJ :i6­ÚûR܈?ÄñW?äÆn6»¬ËoûD;NGÖËÓâ¯TRú&Í__tÇÙ
?ÏG5Ãö-òyÞÈ
           OËã
...
```
After using the `shred` command the history file contains bunch of binary data that is nonsense.

The fact that the file is shredded may in itself be considered evidence of malicious activity. We can eliminate even that by combining the `shred` command with the `-zu` flags

- `-u` deallocate and remove file after overwriting
- `-z` a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding


```powershell
❯ cat $HISTFILE
ls
history -w❯ docker exec -ti 6e0aec73e61c bash

❯ shred -zu $HISTFILE
❯ cat $HISTFILE
cat: /root/.bash_history: No such file or directory
```



## ❯ Killing Bash Process

Using the `kill` command we can exit the session without saving commands in memory to disk using;

```powershell
❯ kill -9 $$
```

## ❯ Using More

We can hide a command from being saved in memory using `more` ability to excute commands by prepending them with `!` 

- `!<cmd>` or `:!<cmd>` Execute `<cmd>` in a subshell

```powershell
❯ ps -aef | more                        
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 Jan20 ?        00:00:03 /sbin/init
root           2       0  0 Jan20 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
root           3       2  0 Jan20 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_gp]
...
!echo "thanks @13_0_0_0_0"
thanks @13_0_0_0_0
------------------------
```
At the more prompt type `!` or `:!` followed by your command.

This same technique can be used with other [GTFOBIN](https://gtfobins.github.io/) like `vim`
